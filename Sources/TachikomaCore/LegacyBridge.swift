// MARK: - Legacy Type Bridge

// This file provides type aliases and bridges to the legacy implementation
// while we work on the modern API

// Import all the legacy types we need from the files in the Legacy directory
// For now, we'll define these as simple typealiases until we can properly import them

// These are temporary placeholders - in a real implementation, these would
// import from the actual legacy files

// The legacy types are now defined in their respective files in the Legacy directory.
// This file provides forward declarations and type aliases that may be needed for bridging.

// These will be imported from the actual legacy implementation
// Once we clean up the type conflicts, these can be removed
